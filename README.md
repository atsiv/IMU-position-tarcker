# IMU-position-tarcker
This program can connect to a BNO-055 IMU, identify a target's position in video and save position and IMU data to file


This program is to identify where the IMU is in video and save position data with the data from the sensor.  The purpose is to gather data and use it to understand Deep Learning.  The goal was to have the sensor spin around a fixed pint, identify the angle at which the sensor is ate relitive to verticle, and save that with the sensor data to a CSV file for use to help me understand Machine Learning techniques.
